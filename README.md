# Task 3: Complete Patterns Integration

## Project Evolution

## Task 2 Foundation

- Singleton Pattern: GameManager, AudioManager
- Basic game with centralized management

## Task 3 Additions

## Observer Pattern

- GameEvent Scriptable Objects for decoupled communication
- Events implemented:
  -- Collected coin
  -- Scored updated
  -- Level completed
- Observers: UIManager, AudioManager

## State Machine Pattern

- Player States:
  -- Idle
  -- Moving
  -- Won
- Game States: Enhanced from Task 2
- State transitions:
  -- Idle -> Moving
  -- Moving -> Idle
  -- Idle -> Won
  -- Moving -> Won

## Key Integration Points

1. Score System: Singleton → Observer → UI
2. Player Actions: Input → State → Event → Audio
3. Game Flow: GameState → Events → Scene Changes
