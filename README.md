## Post-Mortem

### What I learned

After completing this, I learned that even the smallest, simplest components of a game require much time and patience to implement. There were many times when I wanted to throw in the towel while implementing a feature. If I were to do this again, I would either drastically increase my timeline or cut down on certain features.

### Future Improvements [List of features]

* Jumping / Dashing / Dodging
* Improve movement
* Fix controller support
* Spruce up main menu
* Add pause menu
* Background music
* More animations
* Respawn mechanic
